{"name":"WWNDesc","tagline":"WWN Descriptions based on well known WWPN patterns","body":"wwndesc\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWWNDesc is a tool I use to give functional usable nicknames/aliases to devices present on a SAN when a customer may not have them but needs identifiers quickly.  In some cases, these names are used as the canonical names: cases involving very large organizations where the name isn't a huge deal, but having a name is.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n\r\nThis is a standard AutoTools build, so:\r\n\r\n1) autoreconf -vfi\r\n\r\n2) make install (or \"make check\" to include that plus run the tests)\r\n\r\n3) make rpm (if so inclined)\r\n\r\n\r\njava/wwndesc.jar is the proper built jar file; convjars is where \"convenience jars\" are built if \r\nyou're less concerned with license purity and more concerned with:\r\n\r\n1) your tests are bogus.  Let me test exactly what you tested; or\r\n\r\n2) I need it working like yesterday.  Holy crap please help me.\r\n      Gimme something to download immediately to make the pain stop.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've all been there.  In both cases.  grab convjars/wwndesc.jar, it's not sanitary, but it works.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n\r\nExample usage at:\r\n\r\n    java -jar wwndesc.jar -H\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-47807327-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
