\-W\-W\-N\-Desc is a tool \-I use to give functional usable nicknames/aliases to devices present on a \-S\-A\-N when a customer may not have them but needs identifiers quickly. \-In some cases, these names are used as the canonical names\-: cases involving very large organizations where the name isn't a huge deal, but having a name is.

\-This is a standard \-Auto\-Tools build, so\-:

1) autoreconf -\/vfi

2) make install (or \char`\"{}make check\char`\"{} to include that plus run the tests)

3) make rpm (if so inclined)

java/wwndesc.\-jar is the proper built jar file; convjars is where \char`\"{}convenience jars\char`\"{} are built if you're less concerned with license purity and more concerned with\-:

1) your tests are bogus. \-Let me test exactly what you tested; or

2) \-I need it working like yesterday. \-Holy crap please help me. \-Gimme something to download immediately to make the pain stop.

\-We've all been there. \-In both cases. grab convjars/wwndesc.\-jar, it's not sanitary, but it works.

\-Example usage at\-:

java -\/jar wwndesc.\-jar -\/\-H
