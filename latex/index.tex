W\-W\-N\-Desc is a tool I use to give functional usable nicknames/aliases to devices present on a S\-A\-N when a customer may not have them but needs identifiers quickly. In some cases, these names are used as the canonical names\-: cases involving very large organizations where the name isn't a huge deal, but having a name is.

For example\-: you give me\-: 50000972081349ad I give you\-: V\-Max-\/\-H\-K192601234-\/12g\-B (or V\-Max-\/1234-\/12g\-B)

This is a standard Auto\-Tools build, so\-:

1) autoreconf -\/vfi

2) make install (or \char`\"{}make check\char`\"{} to include that plus run the tests)

3) make rpm (if so inclined)

java/wwndesc.\-jar is the proper built jar file; convjars is where \char`\"{}convenience jars\char`\"{} are built if you're less concerned with license purity and more concerned with\-:

1) your tests are bogus. Let me test exactly what you tested; or

2) I need it working like yesterday. Holy crap please help me. Gimme something to download immediately to make the pain stop.

We've all been there. In both cases. grab convjars/wwndesc.\-jar, it's not sanitary, but it works.

Example usage at\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}java -jar wwndesc.jar -H
\end{DoxyVerb}


Example Search for an Alias/\-Description\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}String wwn = "50000972081349ad";
WWNDescription desc = new WWNDescription();

WWNDesc alias;

if (null != (alias = desc.getWWNDescriptor(wwn)))
    System.out.println(alias.toString());
else
    System.out.println("no alias generated from "+wwn);
\end{DoxyVerb}

There are a few \char`\"{}housekeeping\char`\"{} items in the codebase, such as pkg/\-Doxyfile.\-in, the G\-I\-T\-D\-E\-S\-C\-R\-I\-P\-T\-I\-O\-N stuff in the Makefile.\-am, etc.

A bit more unusual\-: \doxyref{java/version.\-java}{p.}{version_8java} ({\tt http\-://chickenandpork.\-github.\-io/wwndesc/classorg\-\_\-1\-\_\-1smallfoot\-\_\-1\-\_\-1wwn\-\_\-1\-\_\-1version.\-html}) is created from java/version.\-java.\-in to include the version in a simple parseable output to ensure that the jar file is read, and the version itself can be read, interpreted, and passed forth in autoconf-\/generated configure scripts in dependent projects.

The basic structure of this project is where W\-W\-N\-Description's ({\tt http\-://chickenandpork.\-github.\-io/wwndesc/classorg\-\_\-1\-\_\-1smallfoot\-\_\-1\-\_\-1wwn\-\_\-1\-\_\-1\-W\-W\-N\-Description.\-html}) get\-W\-W\-N\-Descriptor(\-String wwn) searches through a maintained list of W\-W\-N\-Desc descendents for a O\-U\-I or pattern that matches; the W\-W\-N\-Desc descendent is instantiated, and returned, or get\-W\-W\-N\-Description() returns a null.

Adding new W\-W\-N patterns herein is a case of either extending the existing patterns as manufacturers evolve their usage, or adding new descendent classes of W\-W\-N\-Desc, and adding their classnames to the get\-W\-W\-N\-Descriptor() class. You can see that the get\-W\-W\-N\-Descriptor() function call is relatively simple at this point\-: the logic for whether a W\-W\-N\-Desc descendent matches a given pattern is moved to static function calls. For example, if Net\-Add\-Description\-::get\-Desc(boolean, boolean, String) decides that the given W\-W\-N matches, it'll return an instance of itself; otherwise, it'll return a null. This was done to allow more than one pattern to be represented in the W\-W\-N\-Desc for later expansion\-: for example, a H\-D\-S super-\/class that returns configured subclasses, or configures instances of itself for different personalities.
